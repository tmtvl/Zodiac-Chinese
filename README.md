Zodiac::Chinese - Generate Chinese Zodiac

# SYNOPSIS
---

```Perl6
use Zodiac::Chinese;
my ChineseZodiac $zodiac .= new(DateTime.new(year => $year, month => $month));
```

# DESCRIPTION
---

The Zodiac::Chinese module provides a ChineseZodiac class, which generates a Chinese zodiac sign from a given date. It currently doesn't account for differences between the lunar calendar and Gregorian calendar, so signs generated for late January or early February may be off.
