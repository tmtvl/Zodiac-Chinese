=head1 NAME

Zodiac::Chinese - Generate Chinese Zodiac

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Zodiac::Chinese;

    my ChineseZodiac $zodiac .= new(DateTime.new(year => 2018, month => 2));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Zodiac::Chinese module provides a chinese_zodiac command, which generates a Chinese zodiac sign from a given date. It currently doesn't account for differences between the lunar calendar and Gregorian calendar, so signs generated for late January or early February may be off.
